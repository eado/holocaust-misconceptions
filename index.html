                    <h3>This is definitely NOT true. The Jews were put into forced labor camps where they worked from day to night. This work tired out the young and old, where some of them died. Others were forced to march in the harsh winterâ€”some just fell out of rank. The most known instance was the literal furnaces that they were put into.</h3>

                    <h3>A race is a group with certain physical traits and features. The Jews aren't a race, since anyone can be Jewish. This interpretation should not be accepted since classifying them as a race will tie them to certain behaviors and actions that a group cannout be responsible for as a whole. </h3>
