                    <h3>This is definitely NOT true. The Jews were put into forced labor camps where they worked from day to night. This work tired out the young and old, where some of them died. Others were forced to march in the harsh winter—some just fell out of rank. The most known instance was the literal furnaces that they were put into.</h3>
